Forgotten History More Precursors
FHMP

This mod includes 3 precursors: The Ixardian Corporation, The Ezentian Combine and The Werediran Signal.
All of these precursors will be mentioned by the archivist enclave from Forgotten History, and museum workers will produce extra resources if you have the precursor relics. There will also be precursor traits.

Precursors:
#Iklaxian Union: An empire that relied on gateways to travel. They collapsed when the gateways stopped working. A rare precursor that can only be found in systems with gateways.
Ixardian Corporation: A megacorp that fell when they costumers were defeated by a homicidal empire. A common precursor that can be found anywhere.
#The Lartaxan Realm: A feudal kingdom that relied too much on its vassals. When they rebelled, it fell. A common precursor that can be found anywhere. Is uncommon if you don't have the Overlord DLC.
The Ezentian Combine: An empire so focused on the creation of their grand project, a triple ringworld system, that they didn't notice that the other empires were afraid of their colossi, and died when they did a preemptive strike.
Werediran Signal: An ancient being that causes new civilizations to fall, by sending radio signals into the void. A very rare precursor that can only be found on tropical, alpine or continental planets.
